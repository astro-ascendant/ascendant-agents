# Releasing opencode-ascendant

The npm package `opencode-ascendant` is generated from repo sources by
`scripts/build-opencode-plugin.mjs` (plugin modules from
`.opencode/plugins/ascendant/`, skill tree from `skills/ascendant/`, version
and dependency pins stamped from `package.json` / `.opencode/package.json`).
Never hand-edit `packages/opencode-ascendant/plugin/` or
`packages/opencode-ascendant/skills/` (build output).

Source of truth for the release version is the root `package.json`;
`scripts/sync-versions.mjs` stamps it into every manifest and rebuilds.

## One-time setup (done)

Publishing runs in CI via npm OIDC trusted publishing, so no `NPM_TOKEN`
secret, no one-time passwords. The trusted publisher (repo
`thaletto/ascendant-agents`, workflow `release-opencode.yml`) is configured
on npmjs.com and already validated. Nothing to do here for future releases.

## Release steps

1. Add a changeset `.changeset/<name>.md`:
   ```md
   ---
   "opencode-ascendant": patch
   ---

   What changed.
   ```
   Use `minor` for features, `patch` for fixes.
2. Consume it and restamp:
   ```bash
   make version
   ```
3. Set `version` in the root `package.json` to the new version, then verify:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
   This restamps every manifest, rebuilds all generated copies, and runs
   typecheck, tests, lint, and format checks.
4. The agent commits and pushes to `main`.
5. The agent creates and pushes the tag (confirm first, since pushing the
   tag publishes to npm):
   ```bash
   git tag opencode-ascendant-vX.Y.Z
   git push origin opencode-ascendant-vX.Y.Z
   ```
   The tag must match `packages/opencode-ascendant/package.json`;
   CI enforces this.
   Pushing the tag runs `.github/workflows/release-opencode.yml`, which
   rebuilds the package from sources and runs
   `npm publish --provenance --access public`.

## Local publish alternative

```bash
make publish
```

Versions from changesets, rebuilds, and publishes from your machine.
Needs npm auth with 2FA handled (automation token or `--otp`); prefer the
tag-push CI path above.
